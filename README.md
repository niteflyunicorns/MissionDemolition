# MissionDemolition

## Projectiles: ##
* Black: standard projectile
* Yellow: accelerates after certain time in motion
* Red ( TNT ): explodes all walls in a specific radius
* Purple: breaks into 3 pieces after certain time in motion
* Green: doubles in size after certain time in motion

## Known Issues: ##
* Yellow Projectiles accelarate oddly ( several safeguards are in place to make gameplay more bearable )
* TNT does destroy walls in a range but does not "appear" to explode - this is only aesthetics, not functionality
* If TNT is used to meet the goal, the camera does not stay centered on the castle but moves automatically to the slingshot
